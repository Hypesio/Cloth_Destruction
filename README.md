# Cloth Tearing

This project was made using [CGP](https://github.com/drohmer/CGP), an open source computer graphics programming library.

For the tearing process, we followed some of the guidelines describes in [*Tearable Cloth*](https://core.ac.uk/download/4276039.pdf) written by Kurt Thompson Phillips.

## Results
The cloth used in these videos have a grid shape. That's the reason why some tearing are so clean.
